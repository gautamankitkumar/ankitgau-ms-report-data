# MS Report
This repo is intended to hold the data and the code required to reproduce the entire project. Code to produce the plots are also included.

Majority of the code uses python and jupyter notebooks (hosted on colab). Google colab provides an easy medium for code hosting, convenience and reproducibility. Data present in this repo is made available in individual notebook by cloning this repo appropriately.

# Overview of this repository
The project is structured as follows:

1. _k_ pts convergence tests
2. Planewave cutoff convergence tests
3. Bulk lattice constant calculations
4. Behler Parinello Neural Network training
5. Monte Carlo simulations
6. Visualizing surface excess results
7. Investigating AgAu segregation variation with van der waals forces correction
8. Plotting histogram for near-surface atomic swaps with energy of swap
9. Validating neural network performance on surface relaxed structures
10. Evaluating surface segregation trend for FCC211 surface
